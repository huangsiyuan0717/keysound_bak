the real reason why most chinese students can't speak english properly is not because of the lack of environment or the lack of good teacher or all that kind of bullshit, the underlying reason is simple, it's because you're learning english by translation and not by comprehension, some people have asked me how do you say 「卖萌」 in english? how do you say 「笑掉大牙」in english ? they're always trying to find that specific tranlation that corresponds with that specific chinese phrase，but english doesn't work that way, even if I gave you a translation called 「laugh my teath off」, and you say it to a foreigner, it wouldn't make any sense, what is a car? it's that 4 wheel vehicle that you see running around in the streets， not 「汽车」
